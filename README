To do:

1. Faulty moves

- Queen d5g8 still drives into board!
- also, Queen h8xf8 (after capture)
- after capture, picking up rook at a8 drives fingers into board.

- rook a1b1 didn't work well.  also rook b1xb2.  also rook e1d1.

2. Allow human to pick up a piece and hold it for a while

3. String waypoints together for smooth, non-stop movement

4. Increase arm speed

5. Machine should recognize when it is checkmated & not move (or knock over its king?).

   dgt.chess.decide seems to return 'a1a1' for both lost and stalemated positions.

6. Machine should recognize when it has won & celebrate

7. Push pieces without picking them up

   it would be good to push pieces in the x,y plane rather than pick them up, especially pawns.
   first, slight vertical raise:

     % rosrun kinova_demo pose_action_client.py -v -r m1n4s200 mdeg -- 0 0 -0.008 0 0 0

   need to modify all fourth joint angles to be exactly 180, to avoid wrist spinning!

   also need to calculate a little x offset because y movements are not straight

8. Currently freezes if human player has moved but his king remains in check

9. White pawn promotion isn't working yet
   
   not sure what will happen, need to try makemove with engine's move

10. Add random "thinking time" before robot's move.

11. Change up the opening!
