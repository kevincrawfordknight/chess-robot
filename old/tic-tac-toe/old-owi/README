# How to control the OWI Robotic Arm Edge.

A guy wrote a Linux driver for OWI Robotic Arm Edge:

  notbrainsurgery.livejournal.com/38622.html

It works great!

To get "owi.cc" to compile:

% sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
% pkg-config --libs libusb-lusb-1.0
% g++ -lusb-1.0 owi.cc -o owi.o

It can find the robot arm USB port by itself, using the manufacturer's info.

To turn on light:
  % owi.o 00 00 01

To turn off light:
  % owi.o 00 00 00

Once robot is ordered to move, it just keeps moving!  Be ready with:
  % owi.o 00 00 00
to stop all motors! 

Commands:

First byte: 00: still, 01:up/close, 10:down/open

shoulder elbow wrist grip
  00      00    00    00  = 00 (all stop)
  01      00    00    00  = 40 (shoulder up)
  10      00    00    00  = 80 (shoulder down)
  00      01    00    00  = 10 (elbow up)
  00      10    00    00  = 20 (elbow down)
  00      00    01    00  = 04 (wrist up)
  00      00    10    00  = 08 (wrist down)
  00      00    00    01  = 01 (grip close)
  00      00    00    10  = 02 (grip open)
  00      10    00    10  = 22 (elbow down & grip open)
  00      01    00    01  = 11 (elbow up & grip close)

Second byte:
  00 (rotate stop) 
  01 (rotate clockwise)   
  02 (rotate counter-clockwise)

Third byte:
  00 (light off)     
  01 (light on)

I created a script "move1" to include a time parameter.  E.g.:

  % move1 10 00 00 1    /* raise elbow for one second, then stop */

I also accounted for when two robot arms are plugged into the same Pi, by
modifying the way owi.cc searches for the arm.  I created owi2.cc and move2:

  % owi2.o 00 00 01     /* turn on light of second arm */
  % move2 00 00 00 1    /* turn it on for one second */
